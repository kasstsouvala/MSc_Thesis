                                                    Summary
                                                   ==========
The Brazilian Amazonia has long been recognised as a repository of ecological services not
only for the local communities, but also for the rest of the world. Based on information
from the Brazilian Geographical and Statistics Institute IBGE, the region is characterised
of socioeconomic inequality with an impact on human well-being.

The concept of well-being has been the concern of sciences since Aristotle (384 - 322
BC), but there is no consensus around a single definition. Different aspects to measure the
human well-being include Gross Domestic Product, percentage of population with access
to electric power or measuring the distribution of income in society (Ghosh et al. (2013)).
In this work, we investigate a measure which is indirectly connected to well-being : electric
power consumption per capita.

We explore the information provided by DMSP satellite night-time imagery to measure
the energy consumption in Brazilian Amazonia for the decade 2000 - 2010. Comparison of
measured energy consumption with census data suggests it is valid to use the night-time
satellite images to measure electric power consumption.

According to the World Bank the electricity consumption per capita is a useful unite
to compare consumption between different regions. We develop an electricity consumption
per capita cellular space model for the Brazilian Amazonia by developing a population
distribution model and dividing with the measured electric power consumption. The model
provides information with a cell resolution of 10 km.
